<p>
    <b>Homer Jay Simpson</b> (born May 12, 1956)[40] is a man from Springfield. He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of
    Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be 239 pounds)[41], lazy, and often ignorant to the
    world around him. Although he has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to those he
    cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't.
</p>

<p>
    His favorite color is blue, and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, drinking, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade
    racer,
    playing the piano and horse riding. His favorite kiddie rides are "Stuart Little", "Barney Train" and "Ride the
    Champion Mechanical Horse".
</p>

<p>
    Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G, although he is
    often incompetent and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his time at Moe's Tavern with his
    friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak. At home, he can often be found sitting on the
    couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food and drinking Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abraham Simpson
    II and Mona Simpson. When provoked, he often strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even though he mutually hates his
    wife's sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt Ling and agreed to be the
    minister for Patty's intended homosexual marriage. As a result of this, Homer is her legal adoptive father.
</p>

<p>
    Homer may just be a normal man, but he has had many great achievements and experiences in his life. He has won a
    Grammy, an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space and saved Springfield many times.

<p>
    <b>Bartholomew JoJo "Bart"</b> Simpson (born Feburary 23 or April 1, 1980)[7]is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood,
    disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of
    Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after
    discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit",
    "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled the Simpson
    Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.
</p>

<p>
    Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series[8], he has
    discovered a new comet which was named after him[9], and he also has performed in a successful band with Milhouse
    Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.

<img src="images/lisa.png" alt="Lisa Simpson">

<p>
    <b>Lisa Marie Simpson</b> (born May 9, 1983)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the
    two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.
</p>

<p>
    In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called Lil' Lisa
    on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard achievement of the
    intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. In her
    upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and
    guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by
    those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on her goals and
    strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of
    parental involvement also leads to her lashing out at those who she deems lower than her or even above her. She has
    extreme jealousy from time to time and will do whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she
    deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things through.
